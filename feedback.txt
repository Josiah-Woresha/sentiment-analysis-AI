{'user_input': 'This movie cannot be serious because it has a nerdy looking kid named Curtis killing people. The other two psycho kids are kind of cute but that Curtis kid is just so ugly because he wears these huge, brown, ugly glasses. The actor probably wandered on the wrong set and he was really supposed to go to Revenge of the Nerds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I hate so much about this movie is that Curtis takes his sweet time shooting people. I kept my finger on the fast forward button because he took too long and what was up with his voice? He sounded like he was fourteen and not ten. Another thing I hated was that he kept smiling like an idiot and there was no point to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then they put that annoying kid in the freezer and somehow he found a flashlight in there. That didn&#39;t make any sense and neither did the music. The music didn&#39;t fit any of the scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is slow, boring and a waste of time. Watch a different movie on your birthday.', 'sentiment': 'Negative', 'feedback': 'correct'}
{'user_input': 'Julie Andrews plays a German spy who falls in love with an American pilot Rock Hudson, while on an assignment for Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The songs are beautiful. The two are well-paired. Julie demonstrates a more temperamental side in this film than the nice girl she normally plays. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A half-German, half-English girl who sings beautiful and entertains the troops in WW I, Julie sings some endearing Mancini songs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the film. Some will say it&#39;s a &#34;chick-flick,&#34; but so what. It&#39;s wonderful. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supporting characters are somewhat stereotyped. It may not be up to Rock&#39;s performance in Pillow Talk, Magnificent Obsession, or Giant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blake Edwards shot the film in Ireland and authentic WW I -type planes were used in the film. Scenery for England and France is absolutely gorgeous.', 'sentiment': 'Positive', 'feedback': 'correct'}
